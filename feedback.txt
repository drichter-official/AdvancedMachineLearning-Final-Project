Summary of the Approach
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

They use a U-Net, comparing different backbones for multiclass segmentation of satellite images in
an area around Frankfurt am Main.

They use a categorical focal loss to reduce the impact of the class imbalance, and evaluate their
models with the Jaccard Index and Categorical Accuracy.
They optimize their hyperparameters with a grid search in a pilot experiment.

Segmentation results overall look very good, the best models reach a categorical accuracy of 91%,
or a mean Jaccard Index of 76% respectively.

Evaluation of Approach and Report
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Your report presents sufficient background research and significant effort to understand and clean
your datasets. You go into enough detail on the methods you used, while remaining concise, and you
present a number of interesting experiments you performed.

Your results look promising, and you visualize them well. However, I think they can also be a little
bit hard to gauge. It would be better if you showed the plain image, prediction and ground truth next
to each other, rather than just the predictions of different models overlaid on the image.

I would also have liked to see some random samples from your final models, rather than just the
evaluation on a single cherry-picked image. You could also have analyzed how the model generalizes
to areas in other countries, or continents, to evaluate overfit. Ideally, you should also write
a few sentences, quantitatively comparing your final results to that of existing literature.

I find it a little unfortunate that you dropped your proposal of combining U-Net CNNs with Swin
Transformers for improved road segmentation. This leaves the methods you use a little vanilla, but
this is not necessarily a bad thing considering the scope of the project.

You also do not go into particular detail on the quality of your segmentations, overall. You could
have shown a confusion matrix here, to allow readers to get a better sense of which classes are still
not recognized well.
